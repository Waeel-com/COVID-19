	<h1>COVID-19 Testing and Prevention</h1>

     <p>
      COVID-19 causes a respiratory illness with fever and cough, may lead to severe pneumonia and is similar to the SARS and MERS coronaviruses.
      Coronaviruses are part of a large family of viruses, which can sometimes cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses, such as pneumonia or bronchitis.
<br>
      Symptoms are similar to the flu and include runny nose, headache, cough,
      sore throat, fever and a general feeling of being unwell. This is more common in people with cardiopulmonary disease and people with weakened immune systems.
     </p>
